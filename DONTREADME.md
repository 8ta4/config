## Goals

### Consistency

> How long is `config` designed to run once it's set up?

Once set up, `config` aims to run for at least a year without any extra tinkering.

> Do I need to press any button before bed?

Nope! The schedule automatically kicks in and finishes up based on the times you configure.

> Will the schedule adjust if I go to bed earlier or later than usual?

No. `config` doesn't track your actual bedtime. It only follows the times you've configured.

If you turn in early, you'll still wake up at the usual time.

And if you stay up late, you'll likely feel a bit more tired, which encourages you to head to bed earlier the following night, keeping that sleep schedule nice and steady over the long run.

### Budget

> What's the maximum budget for setting up `config`?

The plan is to keep the total cost under $1,000, significantly less than high-end smart beds that can easily run into the thousands.

### Minimalism

> Which does `config` prioritize more: a smaller hardware footprint or a simpler setup process?

`config` places a higher priority on reducing the hardware footprint. Setting things up only happens once, but extra devices clutter your space every day.
